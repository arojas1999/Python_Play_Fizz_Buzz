# Python_Play_Fizz_Buzz
Challenge from Code in Place.
In the game Fizz Buzz, players take turns counting up from one. If a player’s turn lands on a number that’s
divisible by 3, she should say fizz instead of the number, and if it lands on a number that’s divisible by 5,
she should say buzz instead of the number. If the number is both a multiple of 3 and of 5, she should say
fizzbuzz instead of the number.
